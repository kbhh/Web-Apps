      <h2>Mekelle University</h2>
      Mekelle College was established in 1993 as the Arid Zone Agricultural College, which found a permanent home in Mekelle after a series of re-locations. In 1993, the Arid Zone Agricultural College was again relocated, this time to Mekelle, as the College of Dry-land Agriculture and Natural Resources Management, and permanently settled at the Endayesus Campus, which had been a military barrack since the time of Emperor Menelik.
The Arid Zone Agricultural College started with three degree programs in 1993 with 42 students. After two years, the Faculty of Science and Technology was established at the same campus and, together, these two faculties were then upgraded to Mekelle University College. Side by side the Law Faculty then began by accepting diploma students in the continuing education program.
